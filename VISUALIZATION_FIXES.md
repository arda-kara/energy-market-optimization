# Visualization Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Identified

1. **SAC Training Curves Issue**: The SAC agent was collecting metrics as `episode_returns` but the visualization function was looking for `episode_rewards`.

2. **PPO Policy and Value Loss Display Issue**: The agent comparison plot was not properly displaying PPO policy and value losses.

3. **Inconsistent Metric Names**: Different agents were using different names for the same metrics (e.g., `episode_returns` vs `episode_rewards`, `actor_losses` vs `policy_losses`).

4. **Limited Comparison Visualization**: The original comparison function only showed a subset of metrics and didn't handle different metric names well.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Visualization Functions

- **Updated `plot_training_curves`**: Modified to check for both `episode_rewards` and `episode_returns` for compatibility with different agents.

- **Redesigned `plot_comparison`**: Completely redesigned to focus on a single metric at a time, with better handling of different metric names.

- **Added `plot_comprehensive_comparison`**: Created a new function that displays multiple metrics side by side for a more complete comparison.

### 2. Standardized Metric Names

- **Updated SAC Agent**: Modified the SAC agent to use `episode_rewards` instead of `episode_returns` for consistency with the PPO agent.

- **Added Metric Mappings**: Implemented mappings between different metric names to ensure visualization functions can find the right data regardless of naming conventions.

### 3. New Visualization Script

- **Created `visualize_results.py`**: Developed a standalone script for visualizing existing experiment results.

- **Flexible Output Options**: Added options to specify which metrics to compare and where to save the visualizations.

### 4. Improved Documentation

- **Updated READMEs**: Added detailed documentation about the visualization tools and how to use them.

- **Added Troubleshooting Guide**: Included information about common issues and how to resolve them.

## How to Use the New Visualization Tools

### Visualizing Existing Results

```bash
python -m utils.visualize_results --results-dir ./results/your_experiment --output-dir ./plots/analysis
```

### Using the Visualization Functions in Code

```python
from utils.visualization import plot_training_curves, plot_comparison, plot_comprehensive_comparison

# Plot training curves for a single agent
plot_training_curves(agent_metrics, save_path="training_curves.png", title="Agent Training Curves")

# Plot comparison of a specific metric across agents
plot_comparison(agent_metrics, "rewards", save_path="reward_comparison.png", title="Reward Comparison")

# Plot comprehensive comparison of multiple metrics
plot_comprehensive_comparison(agent_metrics, save_path="comprehensive_comparison.png", title="Agent Comparison")
```

## Benefits of the New Visualization System

1. **Better Compatibility**: Works with different metric naming conventions across agents.

2. **More Comprehensive Visualizations**: Shows more metrics and provides better insights into agent performance.

3. **Easier Analysis**: Standalone script makes it easy to analyze existing results without writing code.

4. **Improved Debugging**: Better visualizations make it easier to identify and fix issues in agent training.
